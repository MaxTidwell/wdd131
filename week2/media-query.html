            <p>And now, O my son, ye are called of God to preach the word unto this people. And now, my son, go thy way,
                declare the word with truth and soberness, that thou mayest bring souls unto repentance, that the great
                plan of mercy may have claim upon them. And may God grant unto you even according to my words. Amen.</p>

            <h2>Ether 12:27</h2>
            <p> And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be
                humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble
                themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them</p>
